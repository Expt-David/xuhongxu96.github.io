Someone owning this domain emailed me earlier this year to express his willing to transfer the domain to me and ask for a reasonable price.

I didn't reply. But yesterday, I found it was on sale and didn't have an owner. So I bought it immediately. Haha, if I had bought it from that person, I might pay a lot more.

I bought from [Domain.com](http://www.domain.com). And I linked it to GitHub Pages, which I think is very convenience without server cost.

I applied [space-jekyll](https://github.com/victorvoid/space-jekyll-template) theme, which is in Vim-like style and has some shortcuts:

- **Space**：Open Menu
- **Esc**：Close Menu or Searchbar

Some other shortcuts are listed in the menu. Cool!

xuhongxu.cn may be deprecated soon. After all, there are too many constraints in China.
